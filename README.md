# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview of Project
•	determine the number of retiring employees per title.
•	identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
•	Then, write a report that summarizes the analysis and helps company for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

Data Modeling
Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. Used a tool like http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com.
 

Data Engineering
•	Use the information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files, and specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
•	Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table


Result 
1.	Employees Eligible for Retirement
•	Of the 300,024 employees within the company, 90,398 (30.13%) are eligible for retirement.
•	Senior Engineer, Senior Staff and Engineer's hold the largest share (23.9%) of employees likely preparing for retirement.
 
2.	Employees Eligible for Mentorship
•	Only 1549 total employees qualify for mentorship/training for an internal promotion.


Summary
Based on the analysis around 90,000 employees are eligible to retire, yet only around 1500 employees are qualified for mentorship/training, which will have huge impact in company once a majority of eligible employees retire.
